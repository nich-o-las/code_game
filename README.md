## Code Trivia Game built using HTML, CSS, and jQuery/Javascript.

### USER STORY:

#### As a programmer, I would like to:
1. Test my knowledge of web-based technologies.
2. See my score incremented each time I answer a question correctly.
2. See my remaining time decremented by 10 seconds each time I answer incorrectly.
3. See my final score at the end of the game.
4. I would like my high score saved in local storage.
